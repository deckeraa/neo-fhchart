Abstract: Fire severity, frequency, and extent are expected to change 
dramatically in coming decades in response to changing climatic conditions, 
superimposed on the adverse cumulative effects of various human-related 
disturbances on ecosystems during the past 100 yrs. To better gauge 
these expected changes, knowledge of climatic and human influences on 
past fire regimes is essential. We characterized the temporal and 
spatial properties of fire regimes in ponderosa pine forests of the 
southern San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado by collecting 175 
fire-scarred tree samples from nine sites across a wide range of 
topographic settings. All tree rings and fire scars were dated using 
standard dendrochronological techniques. Fire-free intervals were 
statistically modeled using the Weibull distribution to provide 
quantitative measures that characterized the historical range of 
variation in pre-Euroamerican fire regimes.
